# InSpec: Inspect Your Infrastructure

DELETE ME
InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security and policy requirements.

```ruby
# Disallow insecure protocols by testing

describe package('telnetd') do
  it { should_not be_installed }
end

describe inetd_conf do
  its("telnet") { should eq nil }
end
```

InSpec makes it easy to run your tests wherever you need.

```bash
# run test locally
inspec exec test.rb

# run test on remote host on SSH
inspec exec test.rb -t ssh://user@hostname

# run test on remote windows host on WinRM
inspec exec test.rb -t winrm://Administrator@windowshost --password 'your-password'

# run test on docker container
inspec exec test.rb -t docker://container_id
```

# Features

- Built-in Compliance: Compliance no longer occurs at the end of the release cycle
- Targeted Tests: InSpec writes tests that specifically target compliance issues
- Metadata: Includes the metadata required by security and compliance pros
- Easy Testing: Includes a command-line interface to run tests quickly

## Installation

InSpec requires Ruby ( >1.9 ).

### Install it via rubygems.org

```bash
gem install inspec
```

### Install it from source

That requires [bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec bin/inspec help
```

To install it as a gem locally, run:

```bash
gem build inspec.gemspec
gem install inspec-*.gem
```

On Windows, you need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) with [Ruby Development Kit](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) to build dependencies with its native extensions.

### Run InSpec

You should now be able to run:

```bash
$ inspec --help
Commands:
  inspec check PATH      # verify test structure in PATH
  inspec detect          # detect the target OS
  inspec exec PATHS      # run all test files
  inspec help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  inspec json PATH       # read all tests in PATH and generate a JSON profile
  inspec shell           # open an interactive debugging shell
  inspec version         # prints the version of this tool
```

# Examples

* Only accept requests on secure ports - This test ensures that a web server is only listening on well-secured ports.

```ruby
describe port(80) do
  it { should_not be_listening }
end

describe port(443) do
  it { should be_listening }
  its('protocols') {should include 'tcp'}
end
```

* Use approved strong ciphers - This test ensures that only enterprise-compliant ciphers are used for SSH servers.

```ruby
describe sshd_config do
   its('Ciphers') { should eq('chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr') }
end
```

* Test your `kitchen.yml` file to verify that only Vagrant is configured as the driver.

```ruby
describe yaml('.kitchen.yml') do
  its('driver.name') { should eq('vagrant') }
end
```

Also have a look at our [example](https://github.com/chef/inspec/tree/master/examples/test-kitchen) that uses `inspec` in combination with `test-kitchen`

## Command Line Usage

### exec

Run tests against different targets:

```bash
# run test locally
inspec exec test.rb

# run test on remote host on SSH
inspec exec test.rb -t ssh://user@hostname

# run test on remote windows host on WinRM
inspec exec test.rb -t winrm://Administrator@windowshost --password 'your-password'

# run test on docker container
inspec exec test.rb -t docker://container_id

# run with sudo
inspec exec test.rb --sudo [--sudo-password ...] [--sudo-options ...]
```

### detect

Verify your configuration and detect

```bash
id=$( docker run -dti ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash )
inspec detect -t docker://$id
```

Which will provide you with:

```
{"family":"ubuntu","release":"14.04","arch":null}
```

## Testing InSpec

We perform `unit`, `resource` and `integration` tests.

* `unit` tests ensure the intended behaviour of the implementation
* `resource` tests run against docker containers
* `integration` tests run against VMs via test-kitchen and [kitchen-inspec](https://github.com/chef/kitchen-inspec)

### Unit tests

```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

If you like to run only one test, use

```bash
bundle exec ruby -W -Ilib:test test/unit/resources/user_test.rb
```

### Resource tests

Resource tests make sure the backend execution layer behaves as expected. These tests will take a while, as a lot of different operating systems and configurations are being tested.

You will require:

* docker

Run `resource` tests with

```bash
bundle exec rake test:resources config=test/test.yaml
bundle exec rake test:resources config=test/test-extra.yaml
```

### Integration tests

These tests download various virtual machines, to ensure InSpec is working as expected across different operating systems.

You will require:

* vagrant with virtualbox
* test-kitchen

**Run `integration` tests with vagrant:**

```bash
cd test/integration
bundle exec kitchen test
```

**Run `integration` tests with AWS EC2:**

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=enteryouryourkey
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=enteryoursecreykey
export AWS_SSH_KEY_ID=enteryoursshkeyid
cd test/integration
KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML=.kitchen.ec2.yml bundle exec kitchen test
```

In addition you may need to add your ssh key to `.kitchen.ec2.yml`

```
transport:
  ssh_key: /Users/chartmann/aws/aws_chartmann.pem
  username: ec2-user
```
